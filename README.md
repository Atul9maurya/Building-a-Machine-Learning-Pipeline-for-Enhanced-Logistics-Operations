# Building a Machine Learning Pipeline for Enhanced Logistics Operations

This project addresses the issue of truck delays in the logistics industry by developing and deploying a 
machine learning model designed to identify and mitigate delays. Delayed truck shipments significantly impact 
logistics companies, leading to increased operational costs and dissatisfied customers. Timely delivery of goods
is essential to meet customer expectations and maintain competitiveness in the logistics sector. By accurately 
predicting truck delays, logistics companies can:

- Enhance operational efficiency through better resource allocation.
- Optimize route planning to minimize delays caused by traffic or adverse weather conditions.
- Reduce costs associated with delayed shipments.
- Improve customer satisfaction by effectively managing resources.
